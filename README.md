# MinecraftCLIChunkSwapper
Simple CLI tool for Swapping Minecraft Chunks in the Anvil World Fromat

A simple project for practicing C# ;) 

![ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/DoubleScripts/MinecraftCLIChunkSwapper/workflows/ASP.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

Preferrably use the native Java Spigot plugin for reliable chunk swapping as this relies on manual byte manipulation rather than Minecraft
s own World Chunks code. This doesn't mean this project is bad or unstable, just not as reliable as the spigot plugin.
